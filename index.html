periodic-plus-smooth decomposition of an image as a pair of images which
minimizes an energy functional. Observing that this energy is a quadratic form,
the purpose of this post is to derive closed form expressions of the underlying
linear operators. These expressions will then be combined in the next
instalments to a conjugate gradient algorithm in order to minimize the energy
of the periodic-plus-smooth decomposition.

In the <a href="posts/20180212-On_the_periodic-plus-smooth_decomposition_of_an_image-01.html">previous instalment</a> of this series, we discussed the need for periodic
images. Although not all images are periodic, some image analysis techniques
are best performed in Fourier space (using the fast Fourier
transform). Applying Fourier-based techniques to images that are <i>not</i> periodic
(as is often the case) generates artifacts. In order to reduce these artifacts,
Moisan (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1">2011</a>) proposed to construct a periodic image that is as close as
possible to the original image. For reasons that will become clearer in the
remainder of this post, he called the resulting construction the
&ldquo;periodic-plus-smooth decomposition&rdquo;.

based on Moisan&rsquo;s paper, called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-010-0227-1">Periodic plus Smooth Image Decomposition</a> (the
author&rsquo;s version can be found on <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00388020">HAL</a>). Besides introducing a quite smart
technique (that I do use for real materials science applications), this series
will be an opportunity to discuss an important topic: how to test the
implementation of an algorithm, and be confident that the test actually
validates the implementation.

<p>
In the <a href="./posts/20150709-Orientation_correlations_among_rice_grains-05.html">previous instalment</a> of this series, I showed that a convincing binary image could be produced from the gray level 3D reconstruction of the assembly of rice grains, using Otsu&rsquo;s threshold. However, I intend to carry out statistical analyses of the <i>grains</i> themselves in the subsequent instalments. Therefore, instead of a binary image of the rice grains, what is really needed is a <i>labelled</i> image, where all voxels which are thought to belong to the same rice grain are tagged with the same label. This is called <i>segmentation</i>, which is the topic of the present post. I will first show that the most basic segmentation technique (namely, detecting connected components in the image) fails in the present case. This calls for a more elaborate strategy, based on the widely popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)">watershed</a> method. However, blind application of the standard watershed strategy leads to over-segmentation. This post will therefore close on a problem-dependent strategy better suited to the present case.

In the <a href="./posts/20150529-Orientation_correlations_among_rice_grains-04.html">previous instalment</a> of this series, we used the circle Hough transform to find the boundary of the sample and define the circular ROI. Within this ROI, we now need to segment the rice grains. In other words, starting from a gray-level image (Fig. 1, left), we want to produce a binary image, where all pixels that we believe belong to rice grains are white, and all background pixels are black (Fig. 1, right). This is the topic of the present post, where we will use Otsu&rsquo;s automated threshold selection. I will first discuss Otsu&rsquo;s method, and propose what I believe is a new interpretation of this rather old technique. Then, I will apply this method to the 3D image of rice grains, using <a href="http://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org88354bc">
<p>
Finding the stress resultant and stress couple in a spherical pressure vessel seems easy enough. Well, this apparently simple problem allows us to highlight subtle thickness effects within shells. It should be emphasized again that these thickness effects have nothing to do with shear corrections. Indeed, shear stresses are null at any point of the spherical pressure vessel. Rather, the thickness effects we are discussing in this series are due to curvature.
</p>

<p>
In the <a href="./posts/20150608-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-01.html">first instalment</a> of this series, I showed that using Koiter&rsquo;s thin shell solution leads to a non-null stress couple, which came as quite a surprise. In the <a href="./posts/20150701-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-02.html">second instalment</a>, I used the exact, 3D solution to derive reference values of the stress couple and stress resultant through integration over the thickness of the shell. In particular, I showed that thickness corrections <i>had</i> to be incorporated.
</p>

<p>
This still does not settle the matter, since the results obtained within the framework of Koiter&rsquo;s thin shell theory (see <a href="./posts/20150608-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-01.html">first instalment</a>) are inconsistent with the reference, 3D elasticity values (see <a href="./posts/20150701-When_a_thin_shell_is_not_so_thin-02.html">second instalment</a>). To reconcile both approaches (3D elasticity vs. shell theory), we need to use a <i>thick</i> shell theory, as illustrated below.

We found the somewhat unexpected result that the stress couple was not null. Besides, we also found that the stress resultant was slightly different from the well-known value N=pR/2. So what was wrong with the previous analysis? To explore this question, we will make use of the exact solution in 3D elasticity.

In this series, this is illustrated with a spherical pressure vessel, for which the stress resultants and couples are studied. &ldquo;Easy enough&rdquo;, you probably think: N=pR/2, M=0 and that&rsquo;s the end of it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel#Stress_in_thin-walled_pressure_vessels">Wikipedia</a>).

The voxel size is about 0.030 mm. This is far too much for the purpose of the present study, since all we are interested in is the determination of the location (coordinates of the centroid) and orientation (principal axes of inertia) of the rice grains. In order to reduce the computation time, the images will first be <i>binned</i>, that is each set of (say) 4×4×4 voxels will be replaced with a unique voxel, with average gray value. 3D binning would usually require three uggly nested loops. There is, however, a much more pythonic way. This is the topic of the present post.

In the <a href="./posts/20150223-Orientation_correlations_among_rice_grains-01.html">first</a> instalment of this series, I briefly introduced orientational order in assemblies of anisotropic particles, and proposed an illustration based on synthetic microstructures. But what I really intend to do in this series is to show how orientational order can be quantified in a &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; sample, namely a packing of rice grains. This of course requires a 3D image of the packing. Fortunately, my lab (<a href="http://navier.enpc.fr/">Laboratoire Navier</a>) is the proud host of a <a href="http://navier.enpc.fr/Microtomographe,297">collaborative microtomography platform</a> and my former colleague Nicolas Lenoir &#x2013;who was in charge of this instrument&#x2013; gave me the opportunity to scan my toy sample in december 2013.

In this series, I will explore the notion of orientational order in random packings of anisotropic (flat or elongated), hard particles. By orientational order, I mean that particles which are close to each other tend to adopt the same orientation. This leads to strong <i>local</i> anisotropy, while the packing may well be <i>globally</i> isotropic; in particular, all orientations of single grains are equiprobable. Local orientational order is stronger when the volume fraction of particles, or their aspect ratio increases.

My blog was previously hosted by Blogger. I have now moved to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and a statically generated blog. This new website is entirely generated with Emacs&rsquo; <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> (the source files of my blog can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbrisard/blog">here</a>; see in particular the <a href="https://github.com/sbrisard/blog/blob/master/sb-blog.el">config file</a>). The stylesheet is inspired by the <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/">Hello Worg</a> website, the simplicity of which I like. It is a rather exciting experience for me to build a whole website &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo;. Of course, there are many things I need to learn, and this blog should hopefully improve with time&#x2026; be patient! Meanwhile, have a look to my previous posts which I have ported to this site. Happy reading!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c51c69">
<p>
The Green operator for strains is defined as the linear operator which maps &#x2013;in a homogeneous material&#x2013; the local prestress to the (opposite of the) local strain. Closed-form expressions of this operator can be derived in the case of periodic boundary conditions, as will be demonstrated in the present post.

<p>
In <a href="./posts/20140112-Elastic_constants_of_an_isotropic_material-03.html">a previous post</a>, I introduced the fourth-rank spherical and deviatoric projection tensors. Any isotropic fourth-rank tensor is a linear combination of these two tensors; in other words, the space of isotropic fourth-rank tensors (with minor and major symmetries) is of dimension 2. Similarly, it can be shown (<a href="./pages/references.html#orgab2c75a">Walpole, 1984</a>) that the space of three-dimensional, <i>transverse isotropic</i> fourth-rank tensors (with minor and major symmetries) is of dimension 6. Furthermore; it is possible to produce a convenient basis of this space. This is the topic of the present post, which is mostly based on the paper by Walpole (<a href="./pages/references.html#orgab2c75a">1984</a>).

<p>
The double dot product of two tensors is the contraction of these tensors with respect to the last two indices of the first one, and the first two indices of the second one. Whether or not this contraction is performed on the <i>closest</i> indices is a matter of convention. In this post, I will show that this choice has some important implications.

<p>
In this post, I will introduce the acoustic tensor of linearly elastic materials. Closed-form expressions of the inverse of this tensor can be derived in the case of <i>isotropic</i> materials. This will later come in handy to derive closed-form expressions of the periodic Green operator for strains.
